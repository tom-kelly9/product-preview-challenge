## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this challenge i learnt about:
- line-height
- letter-spacing
- animations for buttons
- how to correctly use google fonts to get the desired font and font-weight

- the most challenging part of this challenge was introducing a new image for the mobile view. I added both images to the html and used "display: none;" accordingly with @media queries min and max widths.

### Continued development

I realised towards the end of this challenge I need to learn more about box model. I think I used margins when I should have used padding.
